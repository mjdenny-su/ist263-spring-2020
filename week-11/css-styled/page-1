        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="me">
        My name is Matt Denny and I am currently a junior at Syracuse University who has a passion for skiing. Raised a skier at the age of 3, I have always loved being able to go out and adventure whenever possible. I was born in Connecticut and grew up traveling to numerous mountains within the Northeast  for much of my life. One of my more recent goals was to ski the swiss alps, which I was able to accomplish in December of this year.
