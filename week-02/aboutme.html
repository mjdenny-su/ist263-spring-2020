<P>About me </P>
<P>My name is Matt Denny and I am currently a junior here at SU majoring in Finance as well as pursuing a minor in information technology and management. I am from Trumbull, Connecticut right outside Fairfield County and fairly close to NYC. I have always had a passion for sports and grew up playing football and lacrosse.</P> 
<P>Within SU, I'm involved in the Investment Club through Whitman as well as a web design volunteer program for disabled Veterans. As far as career aspirations, I still have a lot to figure out. I'm hoping to compliment my degree in finance with a background in the ISchool and possibly follow a similar path. </P>
